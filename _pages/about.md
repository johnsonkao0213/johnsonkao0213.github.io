Hi! I am Johnson (Kuei-Chun) Kao, a master student studying Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), advised by [Prof. Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/index.html).

Previously, I'm a Research Assistant at Institute of Information Science Academia Sinica, advised by [Prof. Keh-Yih Su](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/kysu/index_en.html).

My research interest lies in the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to equip computers with the ability to understand data across different modalities. Besides, I love to build efficient, reliable and scalable machine learning systems in different scenarios. Previously, I was fortune to work as Machine Learning Scientist with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) at [Appier](https://www.appier.com/en/). I received my B.Sc. degree from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University where I was so lucky to be advised by [Prof. Yung-Ju Chang](https://www.armuro.info/), [Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/), and [Prof. Ching-Chun Huang](http://acm.cs.nctu.edu.tw/).

Specifically, I am interested in the following topcis:
- **LLM and MLLM Understanding**: *Instruction finetuning and prompt optimization of (M)LLMs*, *Multimodal language agents*, *Commonsense Reasoning*
- **Human-AI Communication**: *Explainable AI*, *Ubiquitous computing*
- **Model Compression**: *Structural Pruning*, *Knowledge Distillation*
