I'm currently a Research Assistant at Institute of Information Science Academia Sinica, advised by [Prof. Keh-Yih Su](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/kysu/index_en.html).

My research interest lies in the intersection of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to equip computers with the ability to understand data across different modalities. Besides, I love to build efficient, reliable and scalable machine learning systems in different scenarios. Previously, I was fortune to work as Machine Learning Scientist Intern with [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) at Appier. I received my B.Sc. degree from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University where I was so lucky to be advised by [Prof. Yung-Ju Chang](https://www.armuro.info/), [Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/), and [Prof. Ching-Chun Huang](http://acm.cs.nctu.edu.tw/).

Specifically, I am interested in the following topcis:
- **Natural Language Understanding**: *Math Word Problem Solver*, *Machine Reading (Intelligent Q&A)*
- **Human-ai Communication**: *Explainable AI*, *Ubiquitous computing*
- **Model Compression**: *Structural Pruning*, *Knowledge Distillation*
